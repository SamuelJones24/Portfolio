                <a href="https://samueljones24.github.io/SortingVisualizer/" target="_blank"><p>The sorting visualizer is a program that animates the sorting process of four algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Bogo Sort. Users select an algorithm, and the program generates a random array of numbers to sort. The animation shows each step of the algorithm visually and can be canceled or restarted at any time. The program displays the sorting time, allowing easy comparison of algorithm speed and efficiency. I really enjoyed creating the project as one of my favorite things to study is algorithims and their efficiency.</p></a>

Created using Three.js, it features the main player car driving in a circle trying to avoid the oncomming traffic. The game was a lot of fun to make as I was able to use it to further my knowledge of 3D graphics and Three.js.</p></a>

As the player earns points, they can purchase additional autoclickers and upgrades to maximize their earnings. I created this game as a template for the kids in Orange Belt at iCode to follow, they had a great time playing the game and was able to use my basic game to come up with a number of fun and inventive variants.</p></a>

                <a href=""><p>My AI image generation website, built using OpenAI's Dalle-API in JavaScript, was a great learning experience for me. Through this project, I gained experience working with APIs and integrating them into web development. I also learned about the capabilities of OpenAI's Dalle model in generating creative images from text prompts, and how to optimize the user experience through customizing the generated images with various parameters. This project helped me expand my skills and knowledge in both AI and web development.</p></a>
